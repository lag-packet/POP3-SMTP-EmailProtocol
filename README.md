# POP3-SMTP-EmailProtocol: School Capstone Project

This repository hosts the code and resources for the POP3-SMTP-EmailProtocol capstone project. The project is primarily written in Python and serves as an implementation of the POP3 and SMTP email protocols. 

## About The Project

This project involves the creation of a simple email client and server using Python. The system utilizes the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to receive and send emails, respectively.

There are two main sets of files in this project:

- Files ending with `FINALDEMO`: These files represent the collaborative efforts of the team. They include combined code from all team members.
- Files not ending with `FINALDEMO`: These files represent my individual work, excluding the POP3 server code.

## File Structure

- `Email-Client-FINALDEMO.py`
- `Email-Client.py`
- `MYSQL_DB_SETUP.txt`
- `POP3-SMTP-Server-FINALDEMO.py`
- `POP3-SMTP-Server.py`
- `README.md`
